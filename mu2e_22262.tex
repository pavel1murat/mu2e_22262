  \begin{abstract}

    This note summarizes our effort to understand published results
    on the endpoint determination of the Radiative Muon Capture (RMC)
    spectra. 
%
    We conclude that internal inconsistencies found in the literature make
    it difficult to rely on the results of other experiments when predicting
    RMC background to the search of \MuMinusEPlus\ conversion process.

    However, we establish that uncertainties on the RMC endpoint
    published by the TRIUMF RMC spectrometer group are overestimated
    by a factor of about 4-5, with the real uncertainty of the measurements
    being in the range of 0.4-0.5 MeV, rather than 1.5-2 MeV.

    Using $\chi^2$ fit results in biased estimates of the RMC photon
    spectrum endpoints, so the likelihood fit should be used.
    
    To reliably predict RMC background to  \MuMinusEPlus, Mu2e needs to have
    its own measurement of the endpoint of the RMC photon spectrum on Al.

\section{ RMC as a background to \MuMinusEPlus\ conversion search }

Radiative muon capture (RMC) is one of the most important backgrounds to the search for
\MuMinusEPlus\ conversion on nuclei. In case of the Mu2e target of choice, aluminum,
RMC is also the most uncertain one: the expected signal $e^+$ energy, E = 92.32 MeV,
is close enough to the endpoint of the RMC spectrum on aluminum,
$90 \pm 2$ MeV \cite{RMC_1999_PhysRevC.59.2853}, so variations of the endpoint
energy within the experimental errors could result in significant changes
in the RMC background expectations.
%
%% We note that the uncertainty in the RMC background expectations is mostly due to the
%% published experimental uncertainty of 2 MeV - 
The Mu2e energy resolution of about 300-400 keV
is small compared to a $\sim$ 3 MeV difference between the expected signal energy
and the maximal energy of a positron coming from a conversion of a RMC photon.
However, given the published 2 MeV uncertainty on the RMC spectrum endpoint the two 
numbers are just about 1.5 standard deviation apart, so understanding of the
experimental uncertainty on \kmax\ becomes quite important.

Fortunately, measurements of the photon spectra on nuclei published 
by the TRIUMF RMC spectrometer group in \cite{RMC_1992_PhysRevC.46.1094},
\cite{RMC_1999_PhysRevC.59.2853} provide sufficient information for readers
to reproduce the published photon spectrum endpoints, and in this note
we report on our attempt to do so.

The endpoint of the RMC photon spectrum is determined using the closure
approximation model \cite{RMC_1979_CERN_REF-TH-2967}.
In this model, the photon spectrum is fully defined by a single parameter,
the photon spectrum endpoint energy \kmax:
$$
   {dN \over dx} = {e^2 \over \pi} {\kmax^2 \over {m_\mu^2}}  (1-x) (1-2x+2x^2) x (1-x)^2
$$
where $x = k/\kmax$.

We use published parameterizations of the TRIUMF RMC spectrometer response
to convolute them with the closure approximation spectra, fit the experimental data,
determine the best \kmax\ values and the corresponding fit uncertainties
for different nuclei, and compare the fit results to the published values.

\section { Discussion }
There are several interesting results that have come out of this study, as well as several
questions raised. We find that our fits result in significantly
smaller errors on $\kmax$ than the published ones. It seems very likely that the TRIUMF 
RMC spectrometer collaboration used the wrong definition of the fit errors. The plot on 
page 45 of reference \cite{RMC_1995_Bergbusch_MS_thesis}, shown in figure \ref{fig:BergbuschChiSq}, 
indicates that the fit error has been defined as the change in the parameter value
corresponding to the change in the fit $\chi^2$/DOF by one, rather than the change
by one in the total fit $\chi^2$. The number of bins in the fit histograms
is about 35-40, which agrees with our fit errors being 5-6 times smaller than
the published ones.

    how the fit error is defined for the fit of the $^{16}$O RMC data. }
    \label{fig:BergbuschChiSq}
  \end{figure}

The 1998 parameterization of the detector response gives significantly better
fits of all spectra published by the TRIUMF RMC spectrometer (1992 \cite{RMC_1992_PhysRevC.46.1094},
1995 \cite{RMC_1995_Bergbusch_MS_thesis}, 1998 \cite{RMC_1998_PhysRevC.58.1767}, and 
1999 \cite{RMC_1999_PhysRevC.59.2853}).
The $\chi^2$ of the fits with 1992 parameterization of the detector response are large enough
to suggest the wrong parameterization. Our $\chi^2$ per degree of freedoms are consistent with
the published ones using the 1998 detector response.

However, the 1992 detector response is consistent with the positon and the width of the 
RPC peak published in 1992, while 1998 response is not. 
This confirms internal inconsistency in the 1992 publication.

Lastly, fit $\kmax$ values for the same target in different years vary on a scale large compared
to the fit errors. This shows inconsistency between the different publication years despite
no change in the detector reported in the published works.

\section{ Summary }

The only claim we can confidently make is that the fit uncertainties on $\kmax$ are
of the order of 0.5 MeV, not 2 MeV. Published uncertainties of about 2-3 MeV
have been derived using the wrong procedure (fit of the distribution of $\chi^2$/DOF
instead of the total $\chi^2$ as a function of the parameter). To fully understand the RMC background at Mu2e,
Mu2e will need to measure $\kmax$ for the stopping target material used.


For the planned stopping target material, aluminum, the fit results for $\kmax$ are consistent with 
the published results - around 90 MeV. For background studies at Mu2e, the suggest plan is to use
the published endpoint value for aluminum from TRIUMF, 90 MeV, with an estimated error of 
$\pm 0.5$ MeV. For background estimates, an analysis should be performed using
$\kmax = 90$ MeV and $\kmax + 3\sigma = 91.5$ MeV.


%% Plan : use aluminum data

%% a)Assume $90 \pm 0.5$ MeV, determine the RMC background

%% b) assume kMax + 3 sigma, determine the RMC background
