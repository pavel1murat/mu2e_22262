* Abstract: <TAB> to expand 

  This note summarizes the effort on understanding the kMax fits of the RMC spectra.
  Mistakes and internal inconsistencies found in the published results make it difficult
  to rely on those when predicting RMC background to the search of mu- -->e+ conversion
  process.

  The executive summary is that in order to reliably predict RMC background to mu- --> e+,
  Mu2e needs to measure the endpoint of the RMC photon spectrum on Al.

* building Pasha's 'rmc_fit' package and running code from it: <TAB> to expand 

  1. clone rmc_fit to a release area which has STNTUPLE checked out:

     git clone https://github.com/pavel1murat/rmc_fit.git

  2. follow instructions in rmc_fit/AAA_README.org






* building Michael's fitting package and running it: <TAB> to expand
The old code location still is fine for the previous fit results,
but new results are from a new version used to due a project for a
statistics course
code location /mu2e/app/users/mmackenz/mdc2018/MMAnalysis/rmc_fits/clean_build/
files needed: RMCAlSpectrum.cc, RMCAlSpectrum.hh, smooth.cc, smooth.hh

Running in ROOT:
.L RMCAlSpectrum.cc++g //if already compiled .L RMCAlSpectrum_cc.so
.L smooth.cc++g //if already compiled .L smooth_cc.so this is Pasha's interpolation TF1 function
r = new RMCAlSpectrum()
//Run a single fit
//r->multiTest([n events], "[Response Year]", [Data Year], "[Target]")
//e.g.
r->multTest(1e6, "1998", 1992, "Al")
//plot a response function
//r->plotResponse([Photon Energy], "[Response Year]")
r->plotResponse(90.,"1998")
//plot a convoluted spectrum and a dataset
//r->compareToData([kmax value], "[Response Year]", [n events], "[target]", [data year], [0/1 to draw +- 2 MeV as well])
r->compareToData(90., "1998", 1e6, "Al", 1992, 1)
//Plot of fit kmaxes
//r->drawAllKMaxes("[chi/nll for Chi^2 or NLL fit]")
r->drawAllKMaxes("chi")
r->drawFitChiSq("") //draws chi^2 plot for all z with both fits with both responses




* building Eleonora's 'rmc_fit' package and running code from it: <TAB> to expand...
  The code I am using is /mu2e/app/users/ediociat/RMC_Study/RMC_1118.C
  to run the code to find the best kmax you should do
  root -l
  .L RMC_1118.C++
  doLoop(minKmax,nstep,stepsize,datayear,responsefunctionyear)

  if you are interested in plotting a particulare response function you should type
  root -l
  .L RMC_1118.C++
  plotResponse(energy)      to plot the '92 response function
  plotResponse1998(energy)  to plot the '98 response function

  to compare a particular kmax with the data type
  root -l
  .L RMC_1118.C++
       TH1F *rmc_data= (TH1F*)get_data92_histogram()->Clone("rmc_data");
   or  TH1F *rmc_data=    rmc_data=(TH1F*)get_data95_histogram()->Clone("rmc_data");
   fu(kmax,rmc_data,1,ResponseFuctionyear)

   !!!MY code is still quite slow sorry for it!!!
